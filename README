Pong game for Atmel Atmega16 AVR microcontroller. Using a 8x8 LED matrix, 
monochrome red. Simple pushbuttons for user control. Also implemented a
scoreboard using 7seg displays. A buzzer was also added for producing
annoying sound using PWM. It's a simple PC speaker. =)

The circuit schematic can be found here also. 'schematic_image.png'

There were two methods of displaying on the LED matrix, using interrupts
or normal refresh. Not knowing which one to chose, both of these methods
are implemented:

'src/backbone/pong_refresh.c'
'src/backbone/pong_parallel.c'

These two files contain only the basic functions for user interface, not
the game itself. The file 'src/pong_final.c' is the game implementation
using 'pong_refresh.c' as the backbone.

Also added Proteus Isis file 'proteus/avr_matrix.DSN' for simulation. =)
